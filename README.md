# A note on some color correction

Colors in this file have been 'corrected' slightly to match what's displayed via MacVim. I used the in-built Digital Color Meter app that comes with MacOS to compare hex values. Certain values didn't appear to need modifications. These were the changes:

* purple (background)
 - initial - #292A44 (41,42,68)
 - observed - #292B43 (41,43,67)
 - final - #292945 (41,41,69)
* green (cursor)
  - initial - #94F2E7 (148,242,231)
  - observed - #96F2E7 (150,242,231)
  - final - #92F2E7 (146,242,231)
* green (type def)
  - initial - #2DE0A7 (45,224,167)
  - observed - #39DFA8 (57,223,168)
  - final - #1BE1A6 (27,225,166)
